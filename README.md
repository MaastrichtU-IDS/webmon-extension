### Structure
The browser extension is structured as it follows:
- **`injectbutton.js`**: the script injecting the _donate_ button on the Youtube page and allows donors to interact with the campaign created by the video's uploader
- `popup`: the code that enables the browser popup screen
    - **`popup.js` `popup.html`**: the script generating the right screens that are shown on the popup screen. the styling of these screens use **`uikit.min.css`**. see [getuikit.com](https://getuikit.com/)
    - `utils`: the helpers and interactions for the popup screen
        - **`api.js`**: the script that connects the backend API with the interactions within the popup screen. the methods are used in `popup.js` like `api.getUserDonations()`
        - **`screens.js`**: the script that generates and injects the right screen onto the root of the popup screen based on input from the API. it is used in `popup.js` like `screens.createInfluencerScreen(data)`
- **`manifest.json`**: the configuration file for the browser extension
